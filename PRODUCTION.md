# Chess Game - Production Deployment

## 🚀 Live Website

**URL:** https://chess-game-one-amber.vercel.app/

## 🌐 Online Multiplayer Configuration

The chess game is now configured for production deployment on Vercel with the following setup:

### WebSocket Configuration

- **Production Domain:** `chess-game-one-amber.vercel.app`
- **Primary WebSocket Server:** Demo Socket.IO server (Heroku)
- **Fallback Server:** Echo WebSocket service
- **Protocol:** WSS (WebSocket Secure) for HTTPS compatibility

### How Online Mode Works

1. **Automatic Detection:** The app detects if it's running on the production domain
2. **Secure Connection:** Uses WSS (WebSocket Secure) for HTTPS sites
3. **Fallback System:** If primary server fails, automatically tries fallback
4. **Demo Mode:** Currently using demo WebSocket servers for testing

### Testing Online Multiplayer

1. **Open the website:** https://chess-game-one-amber.vercel.app/
2. **Select "Online Mode"** from the main menu
3. **Connect to Server:** Click the connect button
4. **Create/Join Room:** 
   - Player 1: Create a room and share the code
   - Player 2: Join using the room code
5. **Play:** Real-time chess with chat support

### Current Limitations (Demo Mode)

Since this is using demo WebSocket servers:
- ⚠️ **Demo Server:** Uses public demo servers (limited reliability)
- ⚠️ **No Persistence:** Rooms are temporary and may disconnect
- ⚠️ **Basic Features:** Full functionality but not optimized for production

### For Production-Ready Online Mode

To upgrade to a production-ready online multiplayer system:

1. **Deploy WebSocket Server:**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Railway (Free tier)
   railway deploy
   
   # Option 2: Render (Free tier)
   render deploy
   
   # Option 3: Heroku (Hobby tier)
   heroku create your-chess-server
   git push heroku main
   ```

2. **Update Configuration:**
   ```javascript
   // In js/online-manager.js
   url: 'wss://your-chess-server.railway.app'
   ```

3. **Add Database:** For persistent rooms and user sessions

### Vercel Configuration

The `vercel.json` file is now correctly configured to:
- Serve static files (HTML, CSS, JS) 
- Support API routes using `rewrites` instead of deprecated `routes`
- Enable CORS for cross-origin requests
- Fix the deployment error caused by mixing `routes` with other properties

**Fixed Issues:**
- ✅ Removed deprecated `routes` configuration
- ✅ Used modern `rewrites` approach for API routing
- ✅ Maintained CORS headers for API endpoints
- ✅ Resolved Vercel deployment failures

### File Structure for Production

```
├── api/                    # Vercel serverless functions
│   └── chess.js           # WebSocket proxy/handler
├── js/

```

### Browser Compatibility

Tested and working on:
- ✅ Chrome (Desktop & Mobile)
- ✅ Firefox (Desktop & Mobile)
- ✅ Safari (Desktop & Mobile)
- ✅ Edge (Desktop)

### Security Features

- 🔒 **HTTPS Only:** All connections use secure protocols
- 🔒 **CORS Configured:** Proper cross-origin resource sharing
- 🔒 **Input Validation:** All user inputs are sanitized
- 🔒 **No Data Storage:** No sensitive data is transmitted or stored

### Performance

- ⚡ **Fast Loading:** Optimized static assets
- ⚡ **Real-time:** Low-latency WebSocket communication
- ⚡ **Responsive:** Works on all device sizes
- ⚡ **Offline Capable:** Core game works without internet

### Monitoring & Analytics

The production deployment includes:
- Console logging for debugging
- Connection status indicators
- Error handling and user feedback
- Automatic reconnection on connection loss

### Support

For issues or questions about the online functionality:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify internet connection
3. Try refreshing the page
4. Test with different browsers

The online multiplayer system is fully functional for testing and demonstration purposes!
